Overview of AWS Infrastructure Solutions Designed, Developed, and Implemented Across Live Projects, Integrated with 3rd-Party Tools for Enhanced Visibility, Security, Monitoring, and Scalability.

### 1. Optimized Cron
**Upgraded the infrastructure** by replacing traditional **EC2-based cron job scheduling** with a **serverless solution**. Utilized **AWS CloudFormation**, **AWS Lambda**, **Systems Manager**, and **EventBridge** to automate the process based on **client requirements**. At a specified time (e.g., **Eastern Time**).
**EventBridge triggers Lambda**, which **scales out the required servers** using **Auto Scaling Groups**. Once the server is available, the **Systems Manager** is used to **initiate the cron jobs**. After the jobs are completed, the server is **automatically terminated**, leading to **significant cost savings** by reducing the need for **always-on EC2 instances**. This solution improved **scheduling flexibility**, **eliminated manual cron job maintenance**, and **optimized resource utilization**.

### 2. Centralized logging system for AWS CloudWatch Logs
